# Social Media Mobile App

Created a social media app that creates and stores social media posts using Flutter and Google Cloud Firestore.
Work in progress - plan to add more features to the app as I progress.

## Getting Started

Runs on Android, iOS, and the web

Demo Video showing how the app works, file organization, and overview of code:
